**Hackathon**: 
Voice commands based food ordering system

    * You will integrate a classifier, which can classify the voice commands, into a food ordering system.

Problem Statement:

    Stage 1: Loading data (On colab)
    Stage 2: Training classifier on the studio_data (On colab)
    Stage 3: Deploy your classifier (on server)
    Stage 4: Train your model on Noisy_data(on colab) and deploy your classifier (on server)
    Stage 5: Collect the voice samples and refine the classifier trained on noisy_data, by now using your teamâ€™s data.
