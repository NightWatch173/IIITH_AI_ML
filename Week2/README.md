## M1: Problem Formulation and Solving
	1. Representing Text and Language
		* Three Generations of Features or Representations
			1. Intuition driven representations (hand-crafted)
			2. Representations that are derived based on Statistics, Signal Processing etc
			3. Representations that are Learned
		* What Do We Mean by Representing Text?
		* Bag of Words - Text Domain
		* Bag of Words Histogram
		* Histogram of Word Occurrences
		* High level concept: 1. Implicit Biases in Machine Learning
		* High level concept: 2. Avoid Intermediate problem formulation
	2. Proxy Task - Word2Vec
		* Bag of Words
		* Power of Context
		* Humans and Machines learn fundamentally in different ways
