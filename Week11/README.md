**Pruning**

    * Big Huge Neural Network!
    * Why Pruning?
    * Model Compression
    * TYPES OF PRUNING:
        * Fine Pruning : Prune the weights
        * Coarse Pruning : Prune neurons and layers
        * Static Pruning : Pruning after training
        * Dynamic Pruning : Pruning during training time
    
    * Neuron Pruning
        * Dropping Neurons by Regularization
    * QUANTIZATION
        * Binary Quantization
        * 8-bit uniform quantization
        * Non Uniform Quantization/ Weight Sharing
        * Weight Sharing while Training
        * Deep Compression by Song Han
        * Product Quantization
        * Residual Quantization
    
**Student â€“ Teacher Networks**
    * GoogLe Net
    * Grouped Convolutions
    * MobileNet
    * ShuffleNet
    * MobileNetV2
