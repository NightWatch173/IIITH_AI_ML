We know that an image is a matrix of pixels representing RGB color intensity values. Principal component analysis can be used to reduce the dimensions of this matrix (image) and project back the data from the reduced space  to reconstruct the image. The objective of this experiment is to visualize the image compression which is an applicaion of PCA. Here, we will see an example with an image of a Butterfly."]},{"metadata":{"id":"D6-WG4pJf1bf","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Setup
