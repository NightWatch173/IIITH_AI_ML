The approach of using eigenfaces for recognition was developed by Sirovich and Kirby (1987) and used by Matthew Turk and Alex Pentland in face classification.The eigenvectors are derived from the covariance matrix of the probability distribution over the high-dimensional vector space of face images. The eigenfaces themselves form a basis set of all images used to construct the covariance matrix. This produces dimension reduction by allowing the smaller set of basis images to represent the original training images. Classification can be achieved by comparing how faces are represented by the basis set.The objective of this experiment is to understand how eigen faces can be used to represent the images"]},{"metadata":{"id":"B8qYnsBoyYbJ","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Setup
