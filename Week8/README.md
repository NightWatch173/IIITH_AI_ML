**Mini-Hackathon**

Classify a given pair of stackoverflow posts, as duplicate, direct-link, indirect-link or unrelated. The features will be the word2vec average representation of the two posts, and the label will 4 possibilities mentioned above.

The following activities as a part of this larger problem:

    1. Using pre-trained Word2Vec model, to get a word2vec representation of the 'massaged' stackoverflow data (i.e. no preprocessing would be required)
    2. Building classifiers using SKLearn and reporting accuracies.
    3. We have provided an architecture such that the entire data can be clustered, and classifiers can run on each cluster using multithreading. Your task is to only create a KMeans clustering definition using SKLearn, and plug it at the location asked.
