* Demystifying Chatbot

**Hackathon**: Alexa Chatbot to Suggest a laptop

Follow all of the following steps in sequence:

    1. Setting up Your Alexa Skill in the Developer Console
    2. Setting Up A Lambda Function Using Amazon Web Services
        1. Login to sandbox and activate virtual env
        2. Go to http://aws.amazon.com and sign in to the console
        3. Choose "Services" at the top of the screen, and type "Lambda" in the search box.
        4. Check your AWS region
        5. Configure your aws access
        6. Click the "Create a Lambda function" button
        7. Click on "Author from scratch" .
        8. Configure your trigger
        9. Finish configuring your function
        10. Now go to your Lambda function and select “ Upload a file from Amazon S3 ”
        11.(Optional) Click the Configure test events dropdown menu on the top of the page.
        12. Select 'Alexa Start Session' from the 'Event Template' dropdown.
        13. Type LaunchRequest into the 'Event Name' field.
        14. Click the orange 'Create' button at the bottom of the page
        15. Click the Test button at the top of the page. 1. You should see a light green box with the message: Execution result: succeeded at the top of the page.
        16. Copy the ARN value from the top right
    3. Connecting Your Voice User Interface To Your Lambda Function
    4. Testing Your Alexa Skill
    5. Customize the Skill to be Yours
