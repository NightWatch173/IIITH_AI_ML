Building classifiers using SKLearn and reporting accuracies.\n","3.   We have provided an architecture such that the entire data can be clustered, and classifiers can run on each cluster using multithreading.

Also the code is arranged the same way **\n","4.  Please be clinical in your implementation. Make necessary copies before making edits (as there are several lines of code and might get difficult to track changes). Avoid \"Reset all runtimes\" (as this will force you download entire word2vec again; \"Restart runtime\" is better as it doesn't refresh the drive i.e. all the files that you downloaded will still be present, and only the session variables will be refreshed) ; also be very sure about your changes before running the last KMeans section (else you might have to keep waiting for about 10 to 15 mins each time) \n","5.
