**Hackathon**
Expression Face Recognition and Sequence Expression Recognition:

    1. Expression Face Recognition (EFR) app: It lets you capture your face and checks whether you are authorized and what was your expression.
    2. Sequence Expression Recognition: Three expressions should match in a row. 
    In each step, you have to select an expression and capture an image with that expression on your face. If your facial expression and selected expression matches, then you can go to the next step,otherwise previous step will be repeated. You can redo the process again.
