**Mini-Hackathon** : 
Authorship verification for short messages using stylometry
* Author identification is the task of identifying the author of a given text. It can be considered as a typical classification problem, where a set of books with known authors are used for training. The aim is to automatically determine the corresponding author of an anonymous text.
* The problem is to identify the author of a  book from a given list of possible authors.

* At the end of the experiment, you will be able to :
    * Preprocess the text
    * Write an algorithm to identify author of a given book
    * Use NLTK package
